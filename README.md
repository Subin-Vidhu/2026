# 2026
Personal projects and learning roadmap for the year.

## About
Tracking what I study, build, and ship throughout 2026. Expect course notes, quick prototypes, and small utilities across Python, web, and data work.

- Start date: January 3, 2026
- Sources: Coursera, Udemy, edX, docs, and personal experiments

## Goals
- Finish at least one substantial project per quarter
- Ship small weekly artifacts (scripts, notes, demos)
- Write brief learnings after each course/module
